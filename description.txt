My solution works by getting the list of all file names, reading the corresponding XML files to get all nodes that don't have children, 
and drawing a box around them on the corresponding image using the bounds stored in the node. It then saves the resulting edited image to a new file in the Output directory.
I chose to use Python since I figured it would have good tools for accomplishing this type of task. I had to edit one of the .xml file manually however, since it wasn't valid .xml.
